# cron-job
I'll create a comprehensive job scheduler that handles cron job requests, executes them, and reports success/failures with timeout handling.

I've created a comprehensive Cron Job Scheduler with the following features:
Key Features:

Cron Expression Parser: Supports standard cron format (minute hour day month weekday) with:

* (every unit)
*/N (every N units)
Specific values and comma-separated lists
Range support (e.g., 1-5)


Job Management:

Add jobs with name, schedule, command, and timeout
Enable/disable jobs on the fly
Delete jobs
Visual status indicators


Execution & Timeout Handling:

Jobs execute automatically based on cron schedule
Timeout enforcement (fails if job exceeds timeout)
Real-time status updates (idle, running, success, failed, timeout)


Execution History:

Tracks last 10 executions per job
Shows timestamps, duration, and results
Color-coded status indicators


Real-time Monitoring:

Live clock display
Automatic job execution checking every second
Visual feedback for running jobs (spinning icon)



Try adding a job with schedule */1 * * * * to see it execute every minute! The scheduler simulates job execution with random durations and occasional failures for demonstration purposes.
